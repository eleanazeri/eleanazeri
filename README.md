## 🚀 Featured Projects

**Full-Stack Web Application with CI/CD** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
Node.js/Express REST API with React frontend, deployed on Render. Testing pipeline covers unit, integration, Cypress E2E, and k6 performance tests; CI/CD automated via GitHub Actions with Agile sprint management on Cyclopt.

**Escape Room Management System** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
MySQL relational schema with integrity constraints, role-based privileges, and SQL views. Flask web application with full CRUD functionality across three user roles: players, game masters, and managers.

**AAC Audio Codec** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
Python encoder/decoder pipeline implementing MDCT filterbank analysis/synthesis, Temporal Noise Shaping, psychoacoustic masking-based quantization, and Huffman entropy coding with variable-bitrate codebook selection.

**IEEE 754 Floating-Point Multiplier** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
2-stage pipelined single-precision multiplier in SystemVerilog with normalization, 6 rounding modes, and full exception handling. Correctness verified across all rounding modes and corner cases using SVA concurrent assertions on status flags.

**Computational Intelligence Systems** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
Mamdani and TSK Fuzzy Logic Controllers in MATLAB/Simulink for DC motor speed regulation and autonomous navigation. ANFIS models built for regression (airfoil noise prediction) and classification (epileptic seizure detection) using grid/subtractive partitioning and cross-validation.

**Multi-Cycle RISC-V Processor** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
Full RISC-V datapath in Verilog supporting R/I/S/B-type instructions, 32-register file, and a 5-state FSM control unit (IF/ID/EX/MEM/WB). Deployed on FPGA as a functional accumulator calculator with button-driven input.

**Image Classification on CIFAR-10** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
CNN architectures in TensorFlow/Keras for 10-class image classification. Benchmarked against KNN, Nearest Centroid, and SVM baselines with systematic performance analysis and documentation.

**Numerical Optimization Methods** &nbsp;·&nbsp; [Code](#)  
MATLAB implementation of Steepest Descent, Newton's Method, and Levenberg-Marquardt across multiple objective functions. Extended to constrained optimization via projected gradient methods; Genetic Algorithms applied to a network traffic flow minimization problem under capacity constraints.
